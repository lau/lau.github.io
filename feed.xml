        <title>The need for timezone awareness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A good way to avoid some of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/28/falsehoods-programmers-date-time-zones.html&quot;&gt;pitfalls of time in computer software&lt;/a&gt; is to be explicit about timezones and to use a library that can handle timezones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your software is only used in a single timezone, you might think that timezones are not necessary to think about. But being aware of the timezone is necessary in more situations than what most people assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both of these statements are true you probably need to use a timezone aware date-time library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to validate a datetime that is not UTC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That non-UTC datetime is from a location that observes Daylight Saving Time (DST). For instance most of Europe and North America.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you make software that only operates in a single timezone do you really need
a timezone library? Most likely. If that timezone observes Daylight Saving Time
it is very hard to validate any given point in time without it. &lt;strong&gt;To validate a datetime for a place that observes DST your code has to take DST into account.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timezone aware datetime library is not just there to compare one timezone to
another. It also knows about when DST happens in any timezone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following happens in countries that observe DST:
In the spring, an hour (usually) is skipped when the clocks are set forward. That hour
simply does not exist in “wall time”. So if your end users work with their
local time and you want to make sure if the time they entered is valid,
it is not enough to simply check if it is between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;02:30:00 on March 30th 2014 might be a valid time, but in some timezones it is not.
With a timezone aware timezone library you can validate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of doing that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lau/calendar&quot;&gt;Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, an Elixir date time library I designed. A “wall time” can be valid in one timezone but not in another:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-elixir&quot; data-lang=&quot;elixir&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from_erl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Europe/London&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Calendar.DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Europe/London&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...}}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from_erl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Europe/Copenhagen&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:invalid_datetime_for_timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore if the entered date and time is during a switch off of DST - usually in the autumn -
the time will be ambiguous. So if you need to compare the entered datetime to other
datetimes, you need to ask the user if it the entered datetime was before or after the clocks
were set back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-elixir&quot; data-lang=&quot;elixir&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from_erl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Europe/Copenhagen&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:ambiguous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Calendar.AmbiguousDateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;possible_date_times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Calendar.DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;abbr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;CEST&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;std_off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...},&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Calendar.DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;abbr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;CET&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;std_off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utc-and-the-user-time-zone&quot;&gt;UTC and the user time zone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if all of the users of a system are in the same timezone, you probably want your server software to work with UTC. UTC does not have the ambiguity that other timezones have. If a user has entered a future datetime and wants to be alerted an hour before, you can compare the server time to the entered datetime and then issue an alert one hour before. But in order to compare UTC to the entered datetime, you need to know what the timezone is. And by timezone I do not mean simply an integer with the UTC offset on a certain date. Because UTC offsets can change. You want a timezone name from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iana.org/time-zones&quot;&gt;tz database&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;code&gt;America/New_York&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measuring-the-interval-between-two-datetimes&quot;&gt;Measuring the interval between two datetimes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that a user enters two datetimes:
&lt;code&gt;2014 March 30, 01:00:00&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;2014 March 30, 04:00:00&lt;/code&gt;.
You need to find out how much time there is between the two.
Usually the difference would be exactly three hours. But for some timezones,
the “spring forward” event, where
the clocks are set forward one hour, took place between those two datetimes. For those zones the difference between the two
datetimes is two hours, not three. That is quite a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if your users, like most people, do not have their watch set to UTC, you would need to know which timezone the entered times belong to in order to do that calculation correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, there are timezone libraries that can handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-elixir&quot; data-lang=&quot;elixir&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;at_four&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from_erl!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Europe/Stockholm&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;at_one&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from_erl!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Europe/Stockholm&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;at_four&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;at_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# 7200 seconds is two hours in this case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that example you do not really have to check if the timezone uses DST,
and if so when it switches back and forth from DST. All you have to do
is input the “wall time” and the timezone. The library will handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-another-timezone&quot;&gt;Adding another timezone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the examples have that timezone awareness is necessary even if you have just one user that only uses one timezone. If you suddenly need your software to be used by people in more than one timezone, it is of course easier if your software has already taken timezones into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;timezone-aware-as-the-default&quot;&gt;Timezone aware as the default&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lau/calendar&quot;&gt;Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, I made sure that the
API was designed with timezone awareness as the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a datetime and do not explicitly tell the library which timezone it belongs
to, you cannot create a valid &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt; struct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have to either
provide a valid timezone name or use another module called &lt;code&gt;NaiveDateTime&lt;/code&gt;.
Naïve - it sounds a bit less confidence inspiring than just &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt; does it not? And it takes longer to type. That is
on purpose. My hope is that the name alone makes people
think twice before using it over &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt;. There are a few cases where you
can get away with ignoring timezones and DST, but you really have to be
sure you know what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with date and time is not easy, but it is not all rocket science either. It is not a secret that DST means that hours are skipped and repeated. Programmers can ignore it and live with the consequences.
Or use a library that can handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elixir - The next big language for the web</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article I will explain why
I think
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elixir-lang.org&quot;&gt;Elixir language&lt;/a&gt;
 will make a big
impact in the world of web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-obscurity-to-the-default-choice&quot;&gt;From obscurity to the default choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First a short tale of another language that went from being largely
unknown to very well known:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003 I started using Ruby. A classmate from university was about to
release a web framework for it. You could
write software with much fewer lines of code than in Java. The combination
of Ruby and this new web framework felt so much better for web development
than what I had been using before - PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when a client wanted to redo an e-commerce site, I convinced them to
rewrite it in Ruby and use this new framework that was now called Rails.
Ever since I have been programming Ruby professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then you could look at the download graphs of Rails and Ruby and it was
obvious that Rails was driving downloads of Ruby. Rails took Ruby out of
obscurity and some years later even many non-programmers had heard about this
web framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very interesting to see how quickly Rails went from being used by a handful
of people to being the “it-framework” and the default choice for startups
that needed web based software. And some of them are now traded on the stock
market with market caps in the billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is Twitter. In 2009 Twitter had been experiencing a tremendous
growth of users and traffic. They decided to change core parts of their
infrastructure from Ruby to Scala.
The way Scala handles concurrency made it easier for Twitter to handle the
growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;erlang&quot;&gt;Erlang&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;picture right_img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ericsson_box.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/ericsson_box.jpg 1x, /assets/ericsson_box2x.jpg 2x&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Ericsson equipment mounted on a lighthouse in Cabo Polonio, Uruguay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;picture right_img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cabo_polonio.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/cabo_polonio.jpg 1x, /assets/cabo_polonio2x.jpg 2x&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;View from the same lighthouse in Cabo Polonio, Uruguay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another language that is both functional and has an even longer
history of handling massive concurrency: Erlang.
It was made at Ericsson in the 1980s to allow for better
development of telephony applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use 4G data on your phone it is more likely than not that the data is
going through equipment from Ericsson. And it runs Erlang. Have you ever thought about how
phone operators do not disconnect everyone’s phone calls in order to apply software updates?
Erlang is made to allow phone switch system to run continuously
and supports hotswapping: software updates while the software is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatsapp have hundreds of millions of users.
On most other platforms &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem&quot;&gt;handling more than ten thousand concurrent connections
on one machine is seen as challenging&lt;/a&gt;, but Whatsapp have individual servers with more than 2
million concurrent connections. 2 million connections on a single server, handled by Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erlang is also popular for game servers. Millions of users
play multiplayer games with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/395/ErlangandFirst-PersonShooters.pdf&quot;&gt;game server infrastructure handled by Erlang&lt;/a&gt;
for titles such as Call of Duty and Game of War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Erlang platform has many advantages for serving reliable, scalable
internet applications, it has a proven track record and has been around for
decades. So why is it not a more popular choice for web development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think part of it is that with Erlang it is not as easy to get up and running
with a new website. I do not think it is because the language is very hard to learn - it is not,
but often people will take the path of least resistance.
The Erlang syntax looks a bit strange if you are used to looking at languages
such as C, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Perl etc. And things like package management,
build tools, meta-programming, unicode handling and web frameworks are not as straight forward as
in languages such as Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elixir&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those areas are all addressed in Elixir. Elixir creator José Valim said: “I liked everything I saw in Erlang, but I
hated the things that I didn’t see”. Elixir has its own package management system,
macros, an easy to use build tool and unicode handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elixir is a language that runs on the Erlang VM. So it has all of the benefits
of the mature, battle proven system and you can use the existing Erlang
libraries with no performance penalty. And Elixir adds a bunch of niceties.
One of them is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Kernel.html#|&amp;gt;/2&quot;&gt;pipe operator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between Erlang and Elixir is not just the syntax. But syntax
does matter, and especially for Ruby developers the Elixir syntax will be very
familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;immutability-and-functional-programming&quot;&gt;Immutability and functional programming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elixir is a functional language with immutability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having worked with immutable data for a while, I have realized how
beneficial it is. Even for single threaded
programming, mutability brings an uncertainty about how a program will execute.
And I do not miss the mutability at all. Functional programming
and immutability helps to clarify things and makes it easier to reason about code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concurrency&quot;&gt;Concurrency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strong point for Elixir is concurrency. Concurrency is here to stay, for several reasons.
To mention a few: The trend in hardware
is more and more CPU cores. The CPU manufacturers are not going
to improve single core performance at the same rate as before. Instead they are
adding more cores. Also the world is concurrent and you do not want
end users or other software services to needlessly wait for a response because your
single threaded software is busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most languages concurrency is a bit of a pain. Not only is it dangerous and
hard to do synchronization. With mutable state and forking of native processes it
is also often slow and uses a lot of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing concurrency in Erlang or Elixir versus other languages is a bit like
doing branches in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_software&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion&quot;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;. In subversion it was very complicated to
do - and I never did it. In Git it is a lot easier and I do it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Elixir it is very easy to create a new process and it performs
very well, so if the situation calls for it, it is straightforward to do.
It is an integral part of the platform and does not require a separate library.
Note that Erlang/Elixir processes are not native processes, they are much more light
weight and are scheduled by the Erlang BEAM virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-framework&quot;&gt;Web framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phoenixframework.org&quot;&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular web framework for Elixir right now.
The creator of Elixir is a Rails core member and the creator of Phoenix
also has a background of working with Rails. While there is no desire to
simply recreate Rails in Elixir, it means that Phoenix is also
relatively easy to get started with because Rails has set certain minimum standards
in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting features is the real time capabilities with channels
between javascript on the client and Elixir on any of the servers in the cluster.
Each single visitor to a website can have its own process on the server and its
own real time connection. This opens up possibilities that are not present in
traditional web frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, seeing &lt;strong&gt;μs&lt;/strong&gt; (the microsecond symbol) in web server logs
because of sub 1ms response times is quite nice ;) Efficiency and speed
are important for the end user experience, and also means less waste of
energy and money on servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;programmer-happiness-and-beautiful-code&quot;&gt;Programmer happiness and beautiful code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other languages that are faster than Ruby, but there are still
good reasons to use for instance Ruby over Java: it is a nice language to work with and you
can relatively quickly write concise code. Maybe Java code could perform better,
but in many cases the Java code would
not be as fun or quick to write, nor as easily maintainable.
So the argument of just buying more powerful
servers to make up for it can be a reasonable tradeoff in some cases. But what if you
did not have to make such a choice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Elixir I do not feel like I trade any joy or speed of development for the
performance, reliability and concurrency benefits of the Erlang VM.
Elixir provides all of the Erlang benefits such as performance and reliability
without giving up the productivity benefits of Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dj-vu&quot;&gt;Déjà vu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with Ruby 12 years ago, once again I feel that this new platform is so
much better than the other solutions. And it is not just a gut feeling, there
are rational arguments to back it up. Another similarity is that Dave Thomas
is also excited about Elixir and has written &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937785580/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1937785580&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=creatdelet-20&amp;amp;linkId=WZ5O2FFECAC3DXQC&quot;&gt;a book about the language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is as if everything is aligned for Elixir to be the next new big thing
for web development.
In the last 10 years Ruby and Python have been popular choices for the web.
I think it is likely that in a few years Elixir instead will be the go-to
language for new web projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to save datetimes for future events - (when UTC is not the right answer)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine that it’s January 2015 and you’re making an appointment in a calendar application for a
meeting that will take place in Santiago, Chile on the April 30th at 10:00 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your calendar software saves the appointment and you can see that it’s there
with the description that you made. 2015-04-30 10:00 in Chile. You even checked the box
to get a reminder and think to yourself: “What a time to be alive”. Software
can remind us of meetings and keep track of timezones and we no longer have to
carry around big bulky paper calendars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-saves-the-day&quot;&gt;Software saves the day?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April comes around and you are in Santiago and ready for the meeting you made.
You forgot the exact time of the meeting so you check your trusty calendar
software on your phone. “Ah yes, it’s at 11:00, exactly the time I saved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you show up for your meeting you are surprised that actually the
meeting was at 10:00 and you are an hour late! How did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-deceit&quot;&gt;The deceit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Santiago de Chile&quot; alt=&quot;Santiago de Chile&quot; src=&quot;/assets/santiago.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/santiago2x.jpg 2x&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; class=&quot;right_img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software did not actually save the time 10:00.
Instead it converted the time to UTC (14:00) and saved that along with the timezone
of Santiago/Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the software is smart and can convert it
back from UTC right? Well that just so happens to be a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/28/falsehoods-programmers-date-time-zones.html&quot;&gt;falsehood&lt;/a&gt;.
In most cases, yes, you can convert back from UTC to the original timezone.
But when timezone rules change, converting back to the original timezone
can mean that you get a different result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is just what happens in this case. Because Chile
has decided to stop using Daylight Saving Time. Good for them. Instead of
going off of DST, Chile will essentially keep using the same offset
as they are currently on and not set their clock back in the autumn.
But back in the middle of January the rules were that they were supposed to go off of DST
and set their clocks backward an hour in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened was that your software got the newest timezone update. And then
when converting back from UTC it used the new rules, while the saved UTC time (14:00)
were based on the old rules. With the old rules you would have to subtract 4 hours,
but with the new rules only 3. And subtracting 3 hours from 14:00 you get 11:00
instead of 10:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story is not pure fantasy. You might not be going to Chile in April. But a lot of software actually works this way and
the time zone in Chile is actually announced to be changing as described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-solution&quot;&gt;A solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of saving the time in UTC along with the time zone, developers can save
what the user expects us to save: the wall time. Ie. what the clock on the wall will say. In the example that would be 10:00. And we also save the timezone (Santiago/Chile).
This way we can convert back to UTC or any other timezone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid ambigiuty we also save a third piece of data: the UTC offset. Note that the UTC offset is only
there for the rare cases when the timezone does not change, but when there is an ambiguity we know about at scheduling
time - that will usually be when the timezone goes off of DST and a range of time (usually an hour) happens twice
in autumn when clocks are set back. In this example though this third piece of data is not used for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rare cases where the time zone rules change such that the saved wall time
suddenly becomes &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/28/falsehoods-programmers-date-time-zones.html&quot;&gt;ambiguous or non existant&lt;/a&gt;, the saved UTC offset will not help us.
There is not
much we can do about that though, since we cannot foresee the future. If the
saved datetime becomes ambiguous or non existing, we will have to deal with
that situation by alerting the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that converting to UTC and saving UTC you will never have an ambiguous or
non-existing datetime. That is true, but you have to ask yourself whether it is
better to tell the user something incorrect or tell the user the truth. If
you want your software to provide the most correct answers, this method is
superior to just saving UTC and a timezone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution is implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lau/calecto&quot;&gt;Calecto&lt;/a&gt;: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lau/calendar&quot;&gt;Calendar&lt;/a&gt;-Ecto plugin made by yours truly
for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elixir-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elixir language&lt;/a&gt;.
If you use Elixir with PostgreSQL and Ecto you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lau/calecto&quot;&gt;Calecto&lt;/a&gt; to avoid giving the
wrong answers when timezone change. Just use the Calendar.DateTime type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rule-of-thumb&quot;&gt;Rule of thumb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you are not saving a future time for a meeting? As a rule of thumb:
events that have happened in the recent past can safely be saved as UTC.
Examples are timestamps for when an email has been sent or a database
record has been saved. Your system knows the time in UTC and can save it in
UTC. And later you can always convert it to any other time zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the case of future datetimes such as meetings: converting to UTC and
saving UTC + timezone name is not resistant to changes in time zone rules.
And remember, time zone rules change all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Falsehoods programmers believe about time and time zones</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day has 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counter example: Because of daylight saving time (DST) some days could have 23 hours and some could have 25 hours. Or some other amount of hours - whole or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, but every day without DST changes is 86400 (60 * 60 * 24) seconds long&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some times the UTC offset for a time zone is changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… at least in UTC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nextleapsecond.com/&quot;&gt;Leap seconds&lt;/a&gt; cause some days to have an extra second. And theoretically there could be negative leap seconds. Although negative leap seconds have not happened yet because the rotation of the earth so far has been slower than UTC, as it were, and not faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week one of a year starts in January every year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 1st is not always a monday so some days of an ISO week will be in different years. Example: 2014 December 28th belongs to week 1 of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I know what time zone someone is in and they just tell me the date and local time, I can always use software to find out what time that is in UTC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they are in the middle of changing from summertime to wintertime, the clock will be set back one hour. This means that an hour exists twice, so to speak. If the clock is set back to 2:00 and someone tells you that the local time was 2:17 for instance, you do not know if he is talking about 2:17 before the clocks were set back or 2:17 after the clocks were set back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DST always sets the clock back and forth by exactly one hour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout history there are examples of DST rules that set the clocks back and forth 2 hours or 30 minutes. A current example (h/t &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/derickr/status/560551074701275136&quot;&gt;Derick Rethans&lt;/a&gt;) is Australia/Lord_Howe which advances the clocks by 30 minutes for DST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countries that observe DST begin observing DST in the first half of the year and end observing DST in the last half of the year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in the southern hemisphere, where summer time might begin in October and end in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, but DST always starts around spring and continues until fall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Atlas mountains seen from Marrakesh, Morocco&quot; alt=&quot;Atlas mountains seen from Marrakesh, Morocco&quot; src=&quot;/assets/morocco_palms.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right_img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for Morocco, where in the middle of summer, DST is suspended for a month during Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I have a timestamp for a future event, I can convert it to UTC, store it as UTC along with the time zone and be sure that I can reliably convert it back to the correct “wall time” in the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If time zone rules change in the mean time for the time zone in question, converting back from UTC to “local time” might produce a different result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time zone rules do not change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014 there were 10 updates to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iana.org/time-zones&quot;&gt;Olson database&lt;/a&gt; released during the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I keep my operating system up to date by installing updates, my operating system will have all the newest time zone updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of January 2015 the newest tzdata package for Ubuntu 14 has data from June 2014 and not the latest 2014j release from November 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CST is a unique identifier for a time zone (Central Standard Time in the USA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CST is also used for: Cuba Summer Time, China Time, Central Standard Time (Australia). PST is used for Pakistan Standard Time and Pacific Standard Time. If you want a unique identifier for the time zone in the Pacific West of the USA it looks like this: “America/Los_Angeles”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have two UTC timestamps it is possible to calculate how many seconds will be between them even if one of the timestamps are a year into the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nextleapsecond.com/&quot;&gt;leap seconds&lt;/a&gt; introduced, but you cannot be sure when or how many. However they are announced at least 6 months in advance, so if none of the two times are more than 6 months in the future and you keep up with news about leap seconds you can calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The date-time combination 2014 March 30th 2:20:42 is always valid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In central European time zones such as Europe/Copenhagen, that time does not exist in local time because of DST making the clocks being advanced by an hour from 2:00 to 3:00. This causes an hour to be skipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time 23:59:60 is always invalid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When leap seconds are inserted, a minute will be 61 seconds long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can trust that if someone has written a library to handle date and time, it will work reasonably well&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people write libraries without knowing much about the domain. And developers who also do not know much about the domain will use those libraries. Often things will work fine for a long time if for instance you only deal with timezones in a few countries where the time zone rules do not change a lot. It works fine - until it does not. It can become a case of the blind library developers leading the blind library users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This text was inspired by other “falsehoods programmers believe” posts. And also by my experiences building a &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lau/calendar&quot;&gt;tzdata parser and date-time library for Elixir&lt;/a&gt; and using other date-time libraries through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. This was meant as a thought provoking eye opener. But all of this might seem negative and not constructive. Pointing out problems without any solutions. What can you do, to avoid having these issues cause problems in the systems you develop? I plan to write posts about solutions, so check back here soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>World time is more than GMT offsets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of technology today seems to ignore the complexities of world time, timezones and daylight savings. In fact, as far as I know, there doesn’t even seem to exist a good watch that makes it easy to accurately know the time around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following picture is from Montevideo, Uruguay. It is 3 hours from GMT. And so is Nuuk (aka. Godthåb), Greenland. So while I am in Montevideo in South America I am sort of in the same time zone as Denmark - how about that? This time of year, though, most of Greenland observes DST, so local time in Nuuk is now GMT-2, not -3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/clock.jpg&quot; width=&quot;452&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; alt=&quot;Clock in Montevideo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only adjusting your clock to local time around the world was a question of offsets from GMT, figuring out the local time around the would be relatively easy. What really complicates things is summertime (aka. Daylight Savings Time or DST).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Venezuala there is a certain mad man in charge that wants to create a new seperate time zone! The timezones don’t change that often, but recently there has been changes regarding DST. In USA the days when DST starts and stops was changed in 2007. DST starts and begins on different dates in different countries. Some countries within a certain timezone have DST and some don’t. A European I know asked a local person in a northern African country “Tomorrow at this time, what time is it?” The local person looked very puzzled after hearing the odd question. DST isn’t used in that particular country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t wear a watch regularly, but use my iPhone to get the time. When travelling to a different time zone, I can go to the time settings in the phone and select the city that I am in or a city that I think is in the same time zone. The iPhone will then use it’s internal clock and timezone information for the different cities to calculate the local time in the city in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was in Buenos Aires and, since it is a big city, of course I could find it in the settings on the iPhone. But… I came to find out that my clock was not showing the correct local time. I talked to an employee in the hotel about it and he said that Argentina in 2007 had readopted DST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change made by Argentina had not been reflected in my iPhone nor my &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;index=pc-hardware&amp;amp;keywords=macbook%20pro&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;tag=creatdelet-20&amp;amp;linkId=LJYPT2NZA5CBNQCI&quot;&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that political changes can unexpectedly change timezones and DST. And current “world time” clocks don’t seem reflect these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of technology is developed in Europe or the US, where timezones don’t change that often. And some software developers seem to assume that it works the same way around the world. For instance there is JavaScript software that get a visitors local time from his browser and compare it to GMT to get the visitors GMT offset. That’s fine if you know that the user is in the US for instance. But in most of the Carribean DST isn’t used and in some parts of South America DST is reversed along with summer and winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the lesson for software developers: To accurately calculate a users time zone, knowing a GMT offset is not enough. Getting the closest (politically and geographically) city is best. Furthermore, time zones and DST policies change, so for a world clock to be up-to-date it should probably be updated with the newest time zone changes once a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2015 update: This was written in 2008. Since then I have learned more about timezones and changes to timezone rules. One of those things is that timezone updates happen often. 10 times a year is not that unusual. So updating “once a year or so” will not be often enough in many cases. Today I would recommend to apply every timezone update as soon as it is released.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My iPhone working with my Danish operator without hardware mods</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got a chance to buy an iPhone. After I had made sure that doable iPhone unlocking methods existed, I went for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/iphone.jpg&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unlocking&quot;&gt;Unlocking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engadget recently announced a software unlock. Mainstream media (MSM) has been picking up this story as well as different hardware based unlocks. The only problem with the software unlocks is that they are not available yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it has been possible to use your iPhone with other operators than AT&amp;amp;T for quite some time now, before the ones that mainstream media is currently talking about. One hack is to use a small sim card enclosure called the “turbosim”, but they are sold out. Another one is called the “supersim”. Neither of these methods require you to modify the iPhone hardware. Basically the supersim method works like this: You create a new SIM card that works like your existing local SIM card. Then you use software to activate the iPhone in a way that makes it compatible with this new SIM card. I used the supersim method, and have been using the iPhone with my Danish mobile phone operator since wednesday last week. As far as I know there are only about 5 unlocked iPhones in Denmark right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interface-and-exterior&quot;&gt;Interface and exterior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface is awesome. It’s fun to flick between the pictures and music albums, to zoom in and out on pictures and websites etc. This is really a big step up from the interface of other phones. Like the interface from the Minority Report movie. My previous phone - a Nokia 7610 smartphone feels very 20th century in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtual keyboard works OK - much better than a numeric keyboard with T9. I learned that to avoid typos, you can make sure that the correct key is selected before you lift your finger from the screen - if you hit the wrong key you can slide to a different key before lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exterior is awesome too. It’s not all hard plastic like my old Nokia, but mostly glass and aluminium and a little chrome and rubber-ish plastic. Like a Mac, Apple has been careful about all aspects of the product and how it all works together. That said, it’s not perfect of course. There is plenty of room for improvement and refinement. I welcome software updates with new features. Preferably those updates should be compatible with the SIM unlock hacks ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;email-spam-filtering&quot;&gt;Email spam filtering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an email application called “Mail” similar to the Mac “Mail.app”. It doesn’t have a spam filter like Mail.app does though. So what I did, was to run my email through a GMail account and use setup the GMail account with POP and SMTP on my iPhone. That’s an easy way to get server based spam filtering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;missing-features&quot;&gt;“Missing features”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone doesn’t do everything. You can’t use custom ring tones (without hacking it), it doesn’t send MMS etc. But I don’t care, those features aren’t important to me. On the other hand the iPhone has features that no other phones have, but it is really about the product as a whole and not a checklist of features. For what it is the iPhone is really good. Interacting with my phone is now fun instead of being a bit of a pain. If you want a nice phone with a nice interface, email, a proper web browser and an integrated portable music &amp;amp; video player, the iPhone does a good job.&lt;/p&gt;
